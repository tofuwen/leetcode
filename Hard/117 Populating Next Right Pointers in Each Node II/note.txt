严重怀疑，怎么可能是constant space.

如果用了recursion，那就一定不是constant了！recursion需要栈空间啊！

我错了・・・

妈的，真的可以只用O(1)的空间！！
太巧妙了！！！

It's a BFS traversal. now pointer is the current level traveler and head is the left most element at next level and the tail is the right most element at next level 
till now. We move now pointer at current level and populate the the next-link at its children level. 
(Here the gist is we can move now to its next because this relationship was already populated in the previous round).

void connect(TreeLinkNode *root) {
    TreeLinkNode *now, *tail, *head;

    now = root;
    head = tail = NULL;
    while(now)
    {
        if (now->left)
            if (tail) tail = tail->next =now->left;
            else head = tail = now->left;
        if (now->right)
            if (tail) tail = tail->next =now->right;
            else head = tail = now->right;
        if(!(now = now->next))
        {
            now = head;
            head = tail=NULL;
        }
    }
}
